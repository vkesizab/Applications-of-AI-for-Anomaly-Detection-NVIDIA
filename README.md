# Applications of AI for Anomaly Detection NVIDIA
## Nvidia Deep Learning Institute WorkShop: February 2022
<br />
Implementation of AI-based approaches to solving a specific use case: identifying network intrusions for telecommunications. The Workshop is focused on anomaly detection techniques. Three approaches are implemented:
<br />

- GPU-accelerated XGBoost
- Deep Learning-based Autoencoders
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
<br />

This repository provides a set of Jupyter Notebooks with documentation for the implementation of these techniques.
